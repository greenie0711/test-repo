    "\n",
    "3. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to print the *.ipynb* file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. Do not use AI to solve the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If your document is not clean and organized, you can lose up to 2 points:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto. \n",
    "    - There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of unnecessary results without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.). There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text\n",
    "    - The code follows the [python style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for naming variables, spaces, indentation, etc.\n",
    "    - The code should be commented and clearly written with intuitive variable names. For example, use variable names such as number_input, factor, hours, instead of a,b,xyz, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If your document does not include the output of your code, you may lose up to 5 points."
