### ðŸ”¹ **Question 1: Control Flow, Loops, and Atomic Vectors**

You are given a numeric vector:

`nums <- c(12, 7, 5, 16, 8, 0, 23)`

**Tasks:**

a)  Write a `for` loop that prints whether each element is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.\

b)  Use a `while` loop to print only the numbers in the vector that are **greater than 10**.\

c)  Count how many elements in `nums` are even numbers using a `for` loop and `if` statement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ðŸ”¹ **Question 2: Matrices and Functions**

**Tasks:**

a)  Create a 4x4 matrix with values from 1 to 16, filled by row.\

b)  Write a function `above_threshold()` that takes a matrix and a threshold value as arguments and returns a **logical matrix** of the same size indicating which elements are greater than the threshold.\

c)  Use this function to find which elements in the matrix are greater than 10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ðŸ”¹ **Question 3: Lists and Nested Access**

You are given the following list:

`book <- list(   title = "R for Beginners",   author = "Jane Doe",   year = 2021,   ratings = list(good = 15, average = 5, poor = 2) )`

**Tasks:**

a)  Extract the title from the list.\

b)  Extract the number of "average" ratings using double bracket `[[` notation.\

c)  Add a new element to the list called `publisher` with the value `"DataPress"`.\

d)  Write a line of code that returns the sum of all ratings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ðŸ”¹ **Question 4: Data Frames and Apply Functions**

You have the following data frame:

`grades <- data.frame(   student = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),   math = c(90, 75, 85),   science = c(88, 80, 89),   english = c(92, 70, 85) )`

**Tasks:**

a)  Add a new column `average` containing the average of the three subjects for each student using `apply()`.\

b)  Add a `grade` column where:

    a)  "A" for average â‰¥ 90

    b)  "B" for average â‰¥ 80 and \< 90

    c)  "C" for average \< 80

(Hint: use `ifelse()` or `cut()`.)\

c)  Filter and return only students with a grade of "A".
